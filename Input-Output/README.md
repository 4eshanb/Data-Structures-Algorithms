Refer to Tracery Recursion in the previous directory. 
This is similar to Tracery but instead of always
reading the grammar from a file and writing the expanded grammar to the command
line, we will also be able to read a grammar from the command line and write the
expanded grammar to a file. This will utilize some of the IO 
classes in Java, and how the Java concept of a ​Stream​ provides an
abstraction layer above files and console I/O.

This program loads a grammar either from the console or from a file, based on the
arguments the program was given.
The expanded grammar is written to either the command line or a file, based
on the arguments the program was given.
