# Linked Lists

Implemented a Linked List and a sorted Linked List. 
The linked list implements the interface, ​ListInterface​. 
This linked list stores a list of rhyme groups. Additionally, strings that follow
a specific rhyme scheme are stored within each rhyme group object.
Code in the main method of ​RhymingDict​ that takes lines that have been read from a rhyming dictionary and stores them in the lists.
A subclass of ​MyLinkedList​ called ​MySortedLinkedList​, has a method for adding items into the list in sorted order.
Code in the main method of ​RhymingDict​ that takes pairs of words specified on the command line and outputs whether they rhyme or not.

This assignment was done in my undergraduate studies, specifically Professor Michael Mateas's cmps12b.
