# Search And Sort

I am searching and sorting a large array of words to count how many times different words appear in the array.
The large array of words is Mary Shelley’s novel ​Frankenstein​. Used MergeSort to sort the array, then passed
this array to Binary Search function to count words. Binary Search is used to count words by finding the 
smallest index of a specific word and finding the largest index of that word. This is easily done after the 
array is sorted. Then these indices are subtracted. 

This assignment was done in my undergraduate studies, specifically Michael Mateas's cmps12b.
