# Stacks and Queues

Implement ​MyStack​ using a linked list​ to store the stack elements. The stack implements ​StackInterface.
A ​StackException​ is thrown if peek or pop are called on an empty stack. 
Implement ​MyQueue​ using a linked list to store the queue elements. The queue implements ​QueueInterface.
A ​QueueException​ is thrown if peek or dequeue are called on an empty queue. Used queues and stacks to test
if various strings were palindromes.

This assignment was done in my undergraduate studies, specifically Professor Michael Mateas's cmps12b.
